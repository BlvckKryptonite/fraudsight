## 📌 Project Overview

**FraudSight Risk Analyzer** is a predictive analytics web application designed to identify potentially fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning and interactive data visualisation.

The application combines exploratory data analysis, supervised machine learning, and a Streamlit-based dashboard to support fraud detection, investigation, and performance evaluation. While the deployed version demonstrates core functionality using a representative sample dataset, the full model and dataset are intended to be run locally due to platform upload and memory constraints.

# 📊 Dataset Content

### Source

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

This dataset contains anonymised credit card transactions and is highly imbalanced, making it well-suited for fraud detection tasks.

### Variables

| Variable        | Description                                                     | Example Values        |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `Time`          | Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first one      | `12345`               |
| `Amount`        | Transaction amount                                              | `2.99`, `149.99`      |
| `V1–V28`        | Anonymised PCA-transformed features  (from original dataset)                            | Continuous values     |
| `Class` / `Is_Fraud` | Fraud label (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)                    | `0`, `1`              |

<br>

> **Note:** During preprocessing, the target variable was standardised to `Is_Fraud` for clarity and consistency across notebooks and application code.

## 🎯 Business Requirements

### Stakeholders

- Financial analysts
- Risk management teams
- Compliance and fraud investigation teams

<br>

### Core Requirements

---

| Requirement            | Description                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Visual Analysis**    | Identify trends and patterns in fraudulent transactions  |
| **Predictive Modelling** | Classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate        |
| **Decision Support**   | Highlight high-risk transactions for further review      |

<br>

## 🔬 Hypotheses and Validation

### Hypotheses

1. Fraudulent transactions are more likely to occur outside standard business hours
2. High-value transactions are disproportionately associated with fraud

### Validation Methods

- Time-based aggregation and fraud rate comparison
- Distribution analysis of transaction amounts by fraud label

### Conclusions

| Hypothesis     | Result                                                                 |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hypothesis 1** | ✅ Confirmed — fraud rates increase outside typical business hours     |
| **Hypothesis 2** | ✅ Confirmed — higher transaction values show elevated fraud risk      |

<br>



## 📈 Rationale for Data Visualisations and ML Tasks

| Business Requirement      | Visualisation / ML Task        | Tools                 |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Fraud trend analysis      | Time-series plots              | Matplotlib, Seaborn   |
| Fraud classification      | Random Forest pipeline         | Scikit-learn          |
| Risk inspection            | Interactive tables             | Streamlit, Pandas     |


<br>

## 🤖 Machine Learning Business Case

### Aim:

Reduce financial losses by flagging potentially fraudulent transactions early.

### Model Choice

A **Random Forest classifier** was selected due to:

- Robustness to noisy and imbalanced data
- Strong baseline performance without excessive feature engineering
- Interpretability compared to more opaque models

### Success Metrics

- Recall prioritised to minimise false negatives
- Balanced performance evaluated using cross-validation

### Output

- Binary fraud prediction
- Fraud probability score

## 🛠️ Development Notes & Technical Decisions

### Why so many pull requests?

Early in development, large dataset handling caused repeated deployment and environment issues. To avoid destabilising the main branch, a separate `fixes` branch was used for debugging and recovery work, then merged incrementally.

> This mirrors real-world engineering practice and helped preserve project integrity.

<br>

### Model Tuning vs Diploma Scope

Significant time was initially spent tuning hyperparameters via `GridSearchCV`. While effective locally, this proved excessive for my deployment environment.

As a result:

- Parameter grids were reduced for production
- A stable, performant configuration was prioritised over exhaustive optimisation

> This distinction between local experimentation and production constraints is intentional and documented.

<br>

### Debug Print Statements in Notebooks

Although typically avoided in production code, print statements were retained in selected notebooks (e.g., model training) to support:

- Transparent debugging
- Easier future iteration and retraining
- Clear execution checkpoints during long-running processes

<br>

> Given the complexity of the dataset and training pipeline, as well as the challenges encountered due to differences between local and production environments, this decision prioritised stability, maintainability, and reproducibility of the application.

<br>

## 🐞 Unfixed Bugs & Known Limitations

| Issue                     | Description                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Deployment Upload Limits** | Large CSV uploads (including small samples) may fail on the deployed app due to platform constraints. The Fraud Detector works reliably when run locally with the full dataset. |
| **Class Imbalance Sensitivity** | Very small transaction amounts may show reduced predictive reliability due to class imbalance.        |
| **Table of Contents Anchors** | Due to GitHub Markdown’s handling of emojis in headings, some Table of Contents anchor links may not map correctly in the live GitHub README, despite working as expected in local Markdown renderers. Emojis were intentionally retained for readability and visual clarity.       |


<br>

## 🚀 Deployment

### Live Application

Deployed via Heroku (or equivalent platform). Due to platform constraints, the deployed version uses a representative sample dataset for demonstration.

### Local Setup (Recommended for Full Functionality)

    
    git clone https://github.com/BlvckKryptonite/fraudsight-risk-analyzer.git
    cd fraudsight-risk-analyzer
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    streamlit run src/app.py
    
<br>

> ⚠️ **Important:** To run the full fraud detection workflow, download the complete dataset locally and place it in the `data` directory, replacing the representative sample.
The file **must** be named exactly "`sample_cleaned_transactions.csv`", as this filename is referenced consistently across the application and model pipeline.
